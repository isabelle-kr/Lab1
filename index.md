# Hi, my name is Isabelle.

Welcome to my page! If you'd like, stay a while. Or, jump directly to [some of my favorite memes](#memes).

## About Me
I am a third-year computer science major.

## Computer Science Interests
Top 3 Favorite CSE classes I have taken:
1. CSE105 ([a cool related YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGsU8oIWjY) by Veritasium)
2. CSE21
3. CSE100

As a programmer, I enjoy the K and R bracket style:
```
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```
But I'm not a fan of this:
```
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

## Hobbies
My hobbies are, in no particular order:
- reading
- taking ballet classes
- hiking
- playing with my dog!

> Be true! Be true! Be true!
